2.0.16 (31-10-2014)
- Added CrashProcessingCallback callback function that will be called when crash reporting occurs.
- Added: SendRptPath and DbgHelpPath HandlerSettings members now may accept filenames if these modules exist in same folder as crashrpt.dll
- Fixed bug: crash_rpt::CrashRpt::SendReport crashed on processing assert exception when crashrpt.dll missed (the assert exception was processed as other exceptions).

2.0.15 (26-09-2014)
- Added CRASHRPT_ENABLE_RELEASE_ASSERTS macro which enables the assertion reports to be sent on C "assert" macro for Release configuration.
- Added: all binaries were digitally signed.
- Changed: no error dialog appears if crashrpt has failed to send crash report.
- Fixed bug: crashrpt.dll by default was looking for the sendrpt.exe in the folder with main application .exe (but should look in the folder where crashrpt.dll exist).
- Fixed bug: A file indexing service may interfere with the crash reporting process.

2.0.14 (18-08-2014)
- Added new option -noprogress to symupload.exe
- Fixed bug: symupload.exe was unable to upload symbols

2.0.13 (17-08-2014)
- Breaking changes: To use Doctor Dump SDK you need to redistribute crashrpt.dll, sendrpt.exe, dbghelp.dll instead of crshhndl.dll.

  Now you should use "SkipDoctorDump_" prefix instead of "CrashServer_" to skip functions from processing.
